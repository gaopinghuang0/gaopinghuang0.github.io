# Gaoping's Blog
This blog is used to share my knowledge in programming, statistics, and machine learning. It's built on Jekyll with [Tale][Tale] Themes.

Blog address: <https://gaopinghuang0.github.io>

Draft blog posts are put under `_drafts/*.md` or `_Rmd/*.Rmd` (R Markdown). To auto-convert R Markdown files into `_posts/*.md`, run:
```bash
when-changed _RMD/some-rmd-file.Rmd -c bash convert_rmd.sh _RMD/some-rmd-file.Rmd
```
