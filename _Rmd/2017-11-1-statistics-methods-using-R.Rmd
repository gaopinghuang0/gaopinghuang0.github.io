A brief summary of common statistic methods using R from the book "Discovering Statistics using R" by Andy Field.


## Useful packages
* *stats* - built-in, auto-loaded,
    * `wilcox.test()`
* *car* - for Levene's test, Type III sums of squares
    * `leveneTest()`, such as `leveneTest(viagraData$libido, viagraData$dose, center = median)`
    * `Anova()`, such as `Anova(modelName, type="III")`, see section 11.4.7
* *pastecs* - for descriptive statistics
    * `stat.desc()`, such as `by(viagraData$libido, viagraData$dose, stat.desc)`
* *multcomp* - for *post hoc* tests
* *ez* - for *ANOVA*
* *compute.es* - for effect sizes
    * `mes()`, see section 11.6, calculate effect sizes between all combinations of groups
* *effects* - for adjusted means
    * `effect()`, see section 11.4.8
* *ggplot2* - for graphs
* *WRS* - for robust tests, see section 5.8.4
  * `ancova()` and `ancboot()`, see section 11.5

## Check assumptions
### 1. Normality
Shapiro-Wilk test

### 2. Homogeneity of variance

Levene's test

## Effect size

* Eta squared $(\eta^2)$, see chapter 10

* Partial eta squared (*partial* $\eta^2$ ), see section 11.6

* Omega squared $(\omega^2)$, see section 10.7.
This measure computes the overall effect size. It can be calculated only when we have equal numbers of participants in each group. If it's not the case, then use `rcontrast()` below.

* `rcontrast(t, df)`, see section 10.7 and 11.6.
This measure computes the effect size for more focused comparisons like planned contrasts.
``` {r rcontrast}
rcontrast<-function(t, df)
{
  r<-sqrt(t^2/(t^2 + df))
  print(paste("r = ", r))
}
```

* `mes()`, see section 11.6.
This method calculates effect sizes between all combinations of groups


<!-- ## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
