"Activity" is often undertheorized and used in an intuitive or commonsense way. *Activity Theory* (AT) is a more theoritcial way of looking at activity. Here, I briefly summarize the history of activity theory and its application in human-computer interaction (HCI).

### Initial Theory

The initial version of activity theory originated from Russian/Soviet psychology of the 1920s and 1930s, notably Lev Vygotsky and Sergei Rubinshtein. The goal of activity theory is to understand the mental capabilities of a single individual.  Consiciousness is not isolated cognitive acts (decision making, classification, remembering)., it  and the unity of consciouseness and activity

### Alexey Leontiev's Theory

Activity theory is more of a descriptive meta-theory or framework than a predictive theory.


Nardi et al. in comparing activity theory with cognitive science, argue that "activity theory is above all a social theory of consciousness" and therefore "... activity theory wants to define consciousness, that is, all the mental functioning including remembering, deciding, classifying, generalising, abstracting and so forth, as a product of our social interactions with other people and of our use of tools."[citation needed] For Activity Theorists "consciousness" seems to refer to any mental functioning, whereas most other approaches to psychology distinguish conscious from unconscious functions.
