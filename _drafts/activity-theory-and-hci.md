*Activity theory* is a framework that helps designers and researchers ask the right questions to resolve their complex problems, but does not provide a ready-to-use solution. This is unlike a traditional "theory" that acts as a predictive model. In other words, actiivty theory is more like a meta-theory than a predictive theory.

Here, I briefly summarize activity theory, its origin, and the application to HCI. The content is largely inspired by the book *Activity Theory in HCI - Fundamentals and Reflections* by Kaptelinin and Nardi (2012).

### Theory
The foundational concept of activity theory is "activity", which represents the interaction between the subject (i.e., the actor) and the object (i.e., an entity objectively existing in the world). A common way to represent activity is “S < − > O.”

Subjects interact with objects to achieve some needs through activities. In this process, activites and the entities (i.e., subjects and objects) **mutually** determine one another. On one hand, the properties of subjects and objects define the activities. On the other hand, the activities can transform both subjects and objects.

#### Initial Theory (1920s and 1930s)

The initial version of activity theory originated from Russian/Soviet psychology of the 1920s and 1930s, notably Lev Vygotsky and Sergei Rubinshtein. 


The most fundamental issue for Vygotsky was the relationship between 1) the mind and 2) culture and society.  which is later called "Cultural-historical psychology".

The goal of activity theory is to understand the mental capabilities of a single individual.  Consiciousness is not isolated cognitive acts (decision making, classification, remembering)., it  and the unity of consciouseness and activity

The properties of the subject and the object come from activities. In other words, activities shape the subject and the objejct. This contradicts to another belief that we need to investigate the subject and the object separately and inference the activity.

Hierarchy.

Nardi et al. in comparing activity theory with cognitive science, argue that "activity theory is above all a social theory of consciousness" and therefore "... activity theory wants to define consciousness, that is, all the mental functioning including remembering, deciding, classifying, generalising, abstracting and so forth, as a product of our social interactions with other people and of our use of tools."[citation needed] For Activity Theorists "consciousness" seems to refer to any mental functioning, whereas most other approaches to psychology distinguish conscious from unconscious functions.

### Application in HCI
 and its application in human-computer interaction (HCI).

The unit of analysis proposed by activity theory, that is, “subject-object” interaction, may appear similar to the traditional focus of HCI on “human-computer” interaction. However, adopting an activity theoretical perspective has had important implications for understanding how people use interactive technologies. First of all, it made immediately obvious that “computer” is typically not an object of activity but rather a mediating artifact. Therefore, generally speaking, people are not interacting with computers: they interact with the world through computers. The book by Susanne Bødker which played a key role in introducing activity theory to HCI reflected this perspective on interactive technologies in its title: Through the Interface: An Activity-theoretical Perspective on Human-computer Interaction (Bødker, 1991).

Another general theoretical contribution of activity theory to HCI was placing computer use in the **hierarchical structure of human activity**, that is, relating the operational (low-level) aspects of interactionwithtechnologytomeaningfulgoalsand,ultimately,theneedsandmotivesoftechnology users. It did not mean rejecting the formal models of users and tasks developed in early HCI research, but rather called for extending the scope of analysis beyond low-level interaction to the higher level concerns of motivation and goal seeking. Such an extension is consistent with the need of the field to move “from human factors to human actors” (Bannon, 1991).
