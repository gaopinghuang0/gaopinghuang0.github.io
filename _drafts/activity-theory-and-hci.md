*Activity theory* is a framework that helps designers and researchers ask the right questions to resolve their complex problems, but does not provide a ready-to-use solution. This is unlike a traditional "theory" that acts as a predictive model. In other words, activity theory is more like a meta-theory than a predictive theory.

Here, I briefly summarize activity theory, its origin, and the application to HCI. The content is largely inspired by the book *Activity Theory in HCI - Fundamentals and Reflections* by Kaptelinin and Nardi (2012).

### Theory
The foundational concept of activity theory is "activity", which represents the interaction between the subject (i.e., the actor) and the object (i.e., an entity objectively existing in the world). A common way to represent activity is “S < − > O.”

Subjects interact with objects to achieve some needs through activities. In this process, activities and the entities (i.e., subjects and objects) **mutually** determine one another. On one hand, the properties of subjects and objects define the activities. On the other hand, the activities can transform both subjects and objects.

#### Initial Theory (1920s and 1930s)

The initial version of activity theory originated from Russian/Soviet psychology of the 1920s and 1930s, notably Lev Vygotsky and Sergei Rubinstein. 

Vygotsky is known for the "cultural-historical psychology", which studies the relationship between 1) the mind and 2) culture and society. Two dimensions are significant. The first dimension is external/internal. Human beings use tools to mediate the world, including physical tools (e.g., hammers) and psychological tools (e.g., a map, an algebraic notation). Such culturally developed tools change the structure of human behavior and mental processes. In many cases, subjects who used external tools (mediational artifacts) to solve a task gradually stopped using those artifacts and transitioned to use internal ones. Vygotsky called this phenomenon in terms of internalization. The whole process of solving a task remains to be mediated, but mediated (partially) by internal signs rather than external ones. Note that it does not mean that the internal plane is pre-existing; instead, the internalization creates the internal one.

The second dimension is individual/social (or inter-psychological/intra-psychological). All animals have "natural" psychological functions (e.g., memory, perception), but only human beings have *higher psychological functions* (e.g., driving, navigation using map). New psychological functions are first distributed between individual and other people; they emerge as inter-psychological functions. Initially, the individual cannot perform the function alone. Over time, the individual progressively masters the function so that they can perform without help from others, namely, intra-psychological.

Rubinstein proposed the principle of "unity and inseparability of consciousness and activity", which means human conscious experience (internal) and human behavior (activity, external) are closely interconnected and mutually determine one another. 


#### Alexey Leontiev's Theory

The properties of the subject and the object come from activities. In other words, activities shape the subject and the object. This contradicts to another belief that we need to investigate the subject and the object separately and inference the activity.


Hierarchy.

Nardi et al. in comparing activity theory with cognitive science, argue that "activity theory is above all a social theory of consciousness" and therefore "... activity theory wants to define consciousness, that is, all the mental functioning including remembering, deciding, classifying, generalising, abstracting and so forth, as a product of our social interactions with other people and of our use of tools."[citation needed] For Activity Theorists "consciousness" seems to refer to any mental functioning, whereas most other approaches to psychology distinguish conscious from unconscious functions.

### Application in HCI
 and its application in human-computer interaction (HCI).

The unit of analysis proposed by activity theory, that is, “subject-object” interaction, may appear similar to the traditional focus of HCI on “human-computer” interaction. However, adopting an activity theoretical perspective has had important implications for understanding how people use interactive technologies. First of all, it made immediately obvious that “computer” is typically not an object of activity but rather a mediating artifact. Therefore, generally speaking, people are not interacting with computers: they interact with the world through computers. The book by Susanne Bødker which played a key role in introducing activity theory to HCI reflected this perspective on interactive technologies in its title: Through the Interface: An Activity-theoretical Perspective on Human-computer Interaction (Bødker, 1991).

Another general theoretical contribution of activity theory to HCI was placing computer use in the **hierarchical structure of human activity**, that is, relating the operational (low-level) aspects of interactionwithtechnologytomeaningfulgoalsand,ultimately,theneedsandmotivesoftechnology users. It did not mean rejecting the formal models of users and tasks developed in early HCI research, but rather called for extending the scope of analysis beyond low-level interaction to the higher level concerns of motivation and goal seeking. Such an extension is consistent with the need of the field to move “from human factors to human actors” (Bannon, 1991).
