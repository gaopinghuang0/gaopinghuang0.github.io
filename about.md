I know it's a good practice to write blogs. After spending quite a long time building my own blog site (see [MEAN-blog](https://github.com/gaopinghuang0/MEAN-blog)), I eventually found that a static site is good enough for writing blogs because only the content matters.

Therefore, I chose Jekyll and Github Pages.
